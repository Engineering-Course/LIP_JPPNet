### Introduction

JPPNet is a state-of-art deep learning methord for human parsing and pose estimation built on top of [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org).

This novel joint human parsing and pose estimation network incorporates the multiscale feature connections and iterative location refinement in an end-to-end framework to investigate efficient context modeling and then enable parsing and pose tasks that are mutually beneficial to each other. This unified framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for both human parsing and pose estimation tasks. 


This distribution provides a publicly available implementation for the key model ingredients reported in our latest [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01984.pdf) which is accepted by T-PAMI 2018.

We simplify the network to solve human parsing by exploring a novel self-supervised structure-sensitive learning approach, which imposes human pose structures into the parsing results without resorting to extra supervision. There is also a public implementation of this self-supervised structure-sensitive JPPNet ([SS-JPPNet](https://github.com/Engineering-Course/LIP_SSL)).


### Look into People (LIP) Dataset

The SSL is trained and evaluated on our [LIP dataset](https://lip.sysuhcp.com/) for human parsing.  Please check it for more model details. The dataset is also available at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzvH3bSnp3E9QjVYZlhWSjltSWM?resourcekey=0-nkS8bDVjPs3bEw3UZW-omA&usp=sharing) and [baidu drive](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nvqmZBN).


### Pre-trained models

We have released our trained models of JPPNet on LIP dataset at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BFVXgeln-bek8TCbRjN6utPAgRE0LJZg) and [baidu drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hQvg1TMIt0JA0yMfjyzQgQ).




### Inference
1. Download the pre-trained model and store in $HOME/checkpoint.
2. Prepare the images and store in $HOME/datasets.
3. Run evaluate_pose_JPPNet-s2.py for pose estimation and evaluate_parsing_JPPNet-s2.py for human parsing.
4. The results are saved in $HOME/output

### Training
1. Download the pre-trained model and store in $HOME/checkpoint.
2. Download LIP dataset or prepare your own data and store in $HOME/datasets.
3. For LIP dataset, we have provided images, parsing labels, lists and the left-right flipping labels (labels_rev) for data augmentation. You need to generate the heatmaps of pose labels. We have provided a script for reference.
4. Run train_JPPNet-s2.py to train the JPPNet with two refinement stages.
5. Use evaluate_pose_JPPNet-s2.py and evaluate_parsing_JPPNet-s2.py to generate the results or evaluate the trained models.
6. Note that the LIPReader class is only suit for labels in LIP for the left-right flipping augmentation. If you want to train on other datasets with different labels, you may have to re-write an image reader class.
